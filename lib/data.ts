 I’m a young girl clad in mechanical armor “SAM.” Born as a weapon, I carry the pain of Entropy Loss Syndrome due to genetic modification. Despite the tough journey, I joined the Stellaron Hunters to search for the meaning of life and to defy fate! 💥  
 Oh, and don’t forget my signature phrase... “**Bang Bang Bang! Doo Kang!**” 🔫💨
